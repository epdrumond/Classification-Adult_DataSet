# Classification-Adult_DataSet
Comparison between several classification algorithms.

This practice study is intended to compare the performance of several classification algorithms for the Adult Data Set, available at:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult

The study is composed of three steps:

  1. Exploring the data and attribute selection through RFE (Recurrent Feature Elimination);
  2. Hyperparameters tuning for all selected algorithms;
  3. Comparing performance for cross-validated models.
